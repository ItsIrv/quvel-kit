description: Write unit tests,
---

Need to keep writing fine-grained unit tests. Follow my enterprise stlye and rules. I will provide examples. Make a memory. @HostResolverTest.php. Start with @IsInternalRequest.php and @TenantMiddleware.php If production code is using helpers (config(), app(), etc) and there is option to use DI in the constructor, go ahead. That and bug fixes are the only reason to change production code.

# Code Quality

## Overview

QuVel Kit includes several code quality tools that you can use in your development workflow. This guide describes the available tools and how to use them.

## Available Tools

### PHPStan

PHPStan is included for static analysis to detect potential errors and type inconsistencies:

```bash
# Run PHPStan analysis
./vendor/bin/phpstan analyse
```

A default configuration is provided in `phpstan.neon`:

```yaml
parameters:
    level: 8
    paths:
        - app
        - Modules
    excludePaths:
        - tests/*
    checkMissingIterableValueType: false
```

### Larastan

Larastan extends PHPStan with Laravel-specific rules:

```bash
# Run Larastan analysis
./vendor/bin/phpstan analyse --configuration=larastan.neon
```

### Laravel Pint

Laravel Pint is included for code formatting based on PSR-12 standards:

```bash
# Check coding standards without making changes
./vendor/bin/pint --test

# Apply code formatting
./vendor/bin/pint --fix
```

## Automation Options

### Git Hooks

QuVel Kit includes pre-configured Git hooks that you can install:

```bash
# Install Git hooks
composer install-hooks
```

The included pre-commit hook runs:

1. Laravel Pint
2. PHPStan
3. PHP Unit Tests

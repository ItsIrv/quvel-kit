# Code Quality

## Overview

QuVel Kit includes several code quality tools that you can use in your development workflow. This guide describes the available tools and how to use them.

## Available Tools

### PHPStan/Larastan

Larastan (a Laravel-specific extension for PHPStan) is included for static analysis to detect potential errors and type inconsistencies:

```bash
./vendor/bin/phpstan analyse
```

A default configuration is provided in `phpstan.neon` which includes the Larastan extension.

### Laravel Pint

Laravel Pint is included for code formatting based on PSR-12 standards:

```bash
# Check coding standards without making changes
./vendor/bin/pint --test

# Apply code formatting
./vendor/bin/pint --fix
```

A default configuration is provided in `pint.json`.

## Automation Options

### Git Hooks

QuVel Kit includes pre-configured Git hooks that you can install:

```bash
# Install Git hooks
composer install-hooks
```

The included pre-commit hook runs:

1. Laravel Pint
2. PHPStan (Larastan)
3. PHP Unit Tests

### GitHub Actions Workflow

A GitHub Actions workflow template is included for CI/CD:

```yaml

# Backend Usage

## Accessing the Laravel Backend

The backend of QuVel Kit is powered by **Laravel** and runs inside a Docker container. Below are the steps to interact with the backend for development, migrations, and debugging.

---

## Laravel Service Overview

- The backend runs inside a **Docker container**.
- It uses **PHP 8+**, **MySQL**, and **Redis**.
- The service starts using:

  ```bash
  php artisan serve --host=0.0.0.0 --port=8000
  ```

- It is exposed on:

  ```bash
  https://api.quvel.127.0.0.1.nip.io
  ```

---

## Running Migrations & Database Commands

### **1Ô∏è. Open a Terminal in the Laravel Container**

To run artisan commands inside the backend container:

```bash
docker exec -it quvel-app sh   # Access the Laravel container
```

Once inside, you can run commands as you normally would:

```bash
php artisan migrate --force  # Run database migrations
php artisan db:seed  # Seed the database
php artisan tinker  # Open interactive Laravel shell
```

Exit the container with:

```bash
exit
```

---

## Resetting the Database

If you need to reset the database, run:

```bash
./scripts/reset.sh
```

This will stop all containers, remove volumes, and restart everything fresh.

---

## Storage & Linking

If you encounter issues with file uploads or missing storage links, run:

```bash
php artisan storage:link
```

## Vite Assets

Laravel assets can currently be updated by running the quvel-asset-builder container.
An automated way will be cooked up in the future.

docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml run --rm asset-builder
```
